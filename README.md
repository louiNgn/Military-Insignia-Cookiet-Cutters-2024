# Military Insignia Cookie Cutters 2024

## Five 3D printer cookie cutter models in the shape of various aircraft and army insignias.

This project was mostly made for fun and is a set of .STL files of cookie cutters in the shape of military insignias, perfect for making gingerbread cookies with family and friends during Christmas.

The models include the insignias of the following:
- Vietnam People's Air Force
- The Luftwaffe's Iron Cross
- Armed Forces of Ukraine
- The Red Army
- Spetnaz GRU (I removed the text from the inner cookie imprinter)

## How to use the cookie cutters:
1. Firstly, roll out your preferred cookie dough to your desired thickness (I recommend something that holds its shape well like gingerbread).
2. From there, use the outside part of your chosen cookie cutter to cut out the outline of the cookie dough.
3. Finally, use the middle part of the cookie cutter (that being the imprinter), align it with the cookie cutter, and press down gently just enough to add an imprint on the cookie and nothing further.
4. Repeat to your heart's desire.
5. Place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper and cook them based on recipe instructions
6. Add icing (OPTIONAL) and enjoy!

Print settings I used: 0.2mm layer height, 15% infil (Will probably work at smaller layer heights and higher infil percentages)
Printer used: Anycubic Kobra 2 Plus
